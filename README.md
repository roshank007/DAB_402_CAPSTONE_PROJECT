<h2> What is sentiment analysis? </h2>
<h3>Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral.</h3>

<h2> What is Natural Language Processing??? </h2>
<h3>Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. </h3>

<h3>NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics, in its pursuit to fill the gap between human communication and computer understanding.NLP is used to analyze text, allowing machines to understand how humans speak. This human-computer interaction enables real-world applications like automatic text summarization, sentiment analysis, topic extraction, named entity recognition, parts-of-speech tagging, relationship extraction, stemming, and more. NLP is commonly used for text mining, machine translation, and automated question answering.
